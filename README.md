# Brown Living API

This project is a simple Node.js Express server for a sample e-commerce backend. It provides endpoints to:

- List available products (`GET /products`)
- Calculate the total price for items added to a cart (`POST /cart`)

You can use tools like Postman to test the API endpoints locally on `http://localhost:3000`.

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:
   ```sh
   npm install
   ```
2. Start the server:
   ```sh
   node server.js
   ```
3. Use Postman or your browser to interact with the endpoints.

This is a basic demonstration for learning and testing REST APIs with Node.js and Express.
